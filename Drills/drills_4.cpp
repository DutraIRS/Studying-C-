/*
Problem 1:
Given some integer n (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10000) that is not divisible by 2 or 5,
there exists some multiple of n formed only by 1's (for example,
3 divides 111, 7 divides 111111 and 9901 divides 111111111111).
Your task is to find that number, returning only the amount of 1's.
See the examples of input and output:
>>>7
6
>>>9901
12

Problem 2:
Josephus' problem is known by the legend of Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian
who lived in the first century. In the problem we have 40 soldiers that, to not
give up, decide to kill each other forming a circle, where each one kills the
soldier on his left (for example, if there are 5 soldiers, soldier 1 kills soldier 2,
soldier 3 kills soldier 4, soldier 5 kills soldier 1 and soldier 3 kills soldier 5,
leaving soldier 3 alive). Your task is, given a number of soldiers, to determine
who survived implementing the function recursively. See some examples of input
and output:
>>> 5
3
>>> 11
7

In the original problem they killed with an interval of 3, that is, 1 kills 3,
4 kills 6, 7 kills 9 etc. Implement the solution of this problem recursively, receiving the
number n of soldiers and the k of the interval between the deaths, returning the
survivor. Following the examples:
>>> 5 2
3
>>> 6 3
1
>>> 1234 233
25
